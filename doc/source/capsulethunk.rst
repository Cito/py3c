PyCapsule API for Python 2.6
============================

The ``capsulethunk.h`` heared, implements the PyCapsule API
(with some limitations) in terms of PYCObject.
It is only necessary for compatibility with Python 2.6 (or 3.0).

.. note::
    The ``capsulethunk.h`` header and this documentation was written by
    Larry Hastings for the Python documentation.
    It is now maintained as part of the py3c project.
