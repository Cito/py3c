Cleanup â€“ Dropping Support for Python 2
=======================================

When your users are not using Python 2 any more, or you need to use one of
Python 3's irresistible new features, you can convert the project to use
Python 3 only.
As mentioned earlier, it is usually not a good idea to do this until you
have support for both Pythons.

With py3c, this basically amounts to expanding all its compat macros.
Remove the ``py3c.h`` header, and fix the compile errors.

*   .. index::
        double: Cleanup; Strings
        double: Cleanup; Bytes
        double: Cleanup; Unicode

    Convert ``PyStr_*`` to ``PyUnicode_*``; ``PyInt_*`` to ``PyLong_*``.

*   .. index::
        double: Cleanup; Module Initialization

    Instead of ``MODULE_INIT_FUNC(<name>)``, write::

        PyMODINIT_FUNC PyInit_<name>(void);
        PyMODINIT_FUNC PyInit_<name>(void)

*   .. index::
        double: Cleanup; Types

    Remove ``Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_WEAKREFS`` and ``Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_ITER``
    (py3c defines them as 0).


*   .. index::
        double: Cleanup; Comparisons

    Replace PY3C_RICHCMP by its expansion, unless you keep the ``py3c/comparison.h``
    header.

*   Replace Py_RETURN_NOTIMPLEMENTED by its expansion, unless you either
    support Python 3.3+ only or keep the ``py3c/comparison.h`` header.

*   Drop ``capsulethunk.h``, if you're using it.

*   Remove any code in ``#if !IS_PY3`` blocks, and the ifs around
    ``#if IS_PY3`` ones.

You will want to check the code as you're doing this.
For example, replacing PyLong can easily result in code like
``if (PyInt_Check(o) || PyInt_Check(o))``.

Enjoy your Python 3-compatible extension!
